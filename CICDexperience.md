I don't have any specific experience with workflows and deploying because the undergrad research program I am in programs primarily in Unreal Engine 5 using their built-in block coding language called Blueprints. The reason this doesn't let us use things like piplines or automatic testing is because the blueprint files are saved as binaries, so merging and github reading them is impossible. As for deploying to users, because we are still in the testing and development stage, there aren't users to depoy to. The eventual plan is to put the VR game we're making on Steam or the Meta Quest store, but that's had it's own issues such as getting the program to run natively on ARM (Vulkan isn't playing nice with us).

I do not have experience with continuous integration of continous delivery, I have not yet had the oppurtunity to apply that method.
