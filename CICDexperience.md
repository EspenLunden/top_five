I have experience with workflows and deploying at my part time job I've worked at for almost 3 years. I work with a small team that will collaborate on reposistories implementing new features/changes and fixing old bugs/issues. Our team will push and test all of our changes on a developmental test branch that allows us to ensure our features will work in our production environment before actually pushing the changes into production. We will typically make changes all throughout the month and then at the end of the month we will inform the rest of company of the incoming changes, and then we will push our new features/changes onto our production server for use.
